= club - Club Membership List

Track members for a small non-profit club.

This shows off some basic functionality of JPA and DeltaSpike Data in a JSF environment.

== ToDo

Security blankets:
	1) role="club_exec" only
	2) later: Member, allow members to update their own record (only!)

Use redirect after editing to really go back to the List page.

"Position" should be a relationship to another Entity, with a dropdown chooser.

"Membership Type" should be a relationship to another Entity, with a dropdown.

Search with 'Like' method in DS Data

A confirmation (p:dialog?) on the Edit->Delete button would be a good idea.

Implement the Mailing List page.

Implement the Print Member Badge/Label page.
