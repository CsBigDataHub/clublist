Contributor Notes

If you improve ClubList, please contribute back!

Create a GitHub account (if you don't already have one)
“fork” the repository (makes a copy in your account)
Make and test your changes there.
Review your changes
Send a Pull Request
Code will be reviewed, and incorporated if acceptable
	Please stick to the existing code style
	Please don't make radical changes (e.g. moving files around) without asking first

Sending a pull request constitutes your assertion that you are the original
author of the change(s) and that you have the legal authority on behalf of
yourself and your employer (if employed) to contribute code for distribution
under the existing LICENSE.txt file (it is NOT the GPL most companies should
have no problem with it, but you are responsible for getting the necessary
approvals for code you contribute).

Thanks!!
